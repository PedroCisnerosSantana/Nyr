# Nyr

Nyr is a Smali disassembler and emulator (on the way) for reverse engineers and malware analysts. It is designed to be easy to use yet extremely resilient to even the most complex forms of anti-disassembling.

# Usage

```
python Cli.py {myfile.dex} [outputdir] 
```

# TODO

* Improve disassembler output.
* Implement all the opcodes.
* Test the opcodes.
* Create a pip installer.
* Solve bugs.
